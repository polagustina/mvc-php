# mvc-php
Model View Contoller architecture example in PHP.

I need to implement the API class so the example is more useful.

I also want to work a little more on the explanation of the View class because it's the reason why I figured out how to optimally implement this MVC architecture.

However, this simple implementation should set you up already.
